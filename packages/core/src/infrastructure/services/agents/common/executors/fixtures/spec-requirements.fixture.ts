oneLiner: Add a dark-mode toggle to the Shep web UI settings panel
summary: >
  Introduce a persistent dark-mode toggle to the Shep web UI settings panel that
  applies a CSS class-based theme via Tailwind dark: variants, stores the user
  preference in localStorage, and is surfaced as a shadcn/ui Switch component
  with full Storybook coverage and TDD-driven unit tests.

openQuestions:
  - question: 'Where should the dark-mode preference be persisted?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'localStorage only'
        description: >
          Store the theme preference in localStorage. Zero backend changes,
          instant read on page load, and no need for a settings schema migration.
          The ThemeProvider reads the key on mount and writes on toggle.
        selected: true
      - option: 'SQLite settings via backend API'
        description: >
          Persist the preference in the Shep SQLite settings store alongside
          other settings. Syncs across devices but requires API changes and a
          settings migration — out of scope for this feature.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      localStorage is the conventional approach for client-side theme preferences
      and requires no backend changes. The Shep settings API is out of scope for
      this feature; localStorage ships the value faster with zero migration risk.
    answer: 'localStorage only'

  - question: 'How should the CSS dark-mode implementation be applied?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Tailwind CSS class-based dark mode (dark: modifier)'
        description: >
          Add the dark class to the html element and use Tailwind dark: modifier
          on all themed elements. Supported natively in Tailwind CSS v4 and fully
          compatible with the shadcn/ui component library.
        selected: true
      - option: 'CSS custom properties via a custom ThemeProvider stylesheet'
        description: >
          Define a set of CSS custom properties (--color-bg, --color-text, etc.)
          and swap them by toggling a data attribute. More flexible but requires
          redefining all existing color tokens — a large change surface.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      Tailwind CSS v4 with dark: modifier is already the standard in this codebase.
      All shadcn/ui components are built to accept Tailwind dark: variants. Using
      the dark class on html is the minimal, zero-extra-dependency approach.
    answer: 'Tailwind CSS class-based dark mode (dark: modifier)'

  ## Problem Statement

  The Shep web UI currently renders only in light mode. Developers working in dark
  environments or those who prefer dark themes have no way to switch the UI appearance.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] A ThemeProvider wraps the root layout and provides a useTheme hook
  - [ ] A ThemeToggle component renders in the settings panel with a Switch and label
  - [ ] Clicking the toggle switches the html element class between light and dark
  - [ ] The preference persists across page refreshes via localStorage
  - [ ] All new components have Storybook stories with light and dark variants
  - [ ] pnpm validate passes with no new errors

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: A ThemeProvider component must wrap the root Next.js App Router layout
    and provide theme state to the component tree via React context.
  - **FR-2**: A useTheme hook must expose { theme, toggleTheme } to any component.
  - **FR-3**: A ThemeToggle component must render a Switch and a label (Dark mode).
  - **FR-4**: Toggling the Switch must apply the dark CSS class to the html element.
  - **FR-5**: The selected theme must be persisted to localStorage and restored on load.
  - **FR-6**: ThemeToggle must appear in the settings panel (features/settings/).

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: Theme switch must complete within one animation frame (no FOUC).
  - **NFR-2**: All new components must have Storybook stories per project conventions.
  - **NFR-3**: No new npm dependencies may be added; use existing React, Tailwind, shadcn/ui.
  - **NFR-4**: Each new file must stay within the 150-line project guideline.

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | Persistence layer? | localStorage | Zero backend changes required |
  | 2 | CSS implementation? | Tailwind dark: class | Already standard in the codebase |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | src/presentation/web/components/features/settings/ | High | Toggle component added here |
  | src/presentation/web/app/layout.tsx | Medium | ThemeProvider wrapper added |
  | src/presentation/web/components/common/ | Medium | ThemeToggle and ThemeProvider created |

  ## Dependencies

  - shadcn/ui Switch and Label components (already installed)
  - React context API (built-in)
  - localStorage Web API (built-in)

  ## Size Estimate

  **M (days)** — 3 phases: context + provider, toggle component, settings integration.
