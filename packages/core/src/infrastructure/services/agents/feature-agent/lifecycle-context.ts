/**
 * Lifecycle Context
 *
 * Module-level singleton that allows graph nodes to update the feature's
 * SDLC lifecycle as they execute, following the same pattern as
 * phase-timing-context.ts.
 *
 * The worker calls setLifecycleContext() once after DI init, passing an
 * UpdateFeatureLifecycleUseCase instance. Nodes call updateNodeLifecycle()
 * at the start of execution. Errors are swallowed so lifecycle updates
 * never block graph execution.
 *
 * Routing lifecycle updates through UpdateFeatureLifecycleUseCase ensures
 * that CheckAndUnblockFeaturesUseCase fires on every transition,
 * automatically unblocking blocked children that are now eligible to start.
