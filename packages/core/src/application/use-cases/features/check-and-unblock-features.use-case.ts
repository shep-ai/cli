/**
 * CheckAndUnblockFeaturesUseCase
 *
 * Evaluates whether blocked direct children of a parent feature are now
 * eligible to start, and if so transitions them to Started and spawns their
 * agents.
 *
 * Business Rules:
 * - Only direct children of parentFeatureId are evaluated (no recursive traversal).
 *   Grandchildren stay Blocked until their own direct parent progresses.
 * - Gate: parent lifecycle must be in POST_IMPLEMENTATION (Implementation, Review, Maintain).
 * - Idempotent: already-Started children are not touched; calling execute() twice is safe.
 * - spawn() is skipped for children missing agentRunId or specPath (defensive guard).
 *
 * Called from: UpdateFeatureLifecycleUseCase after every lifecycle transition.
