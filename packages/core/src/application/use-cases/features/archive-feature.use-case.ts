/**
 * Archive Feature Use Case
 *
 * Transitions a feature's lifecycle to Archived, storing the current lifecycle
 * in previousLifecycle for restoration on unarchive.
 *
 * Business Rules:
 * - Any feature can be archived except those already Archived or Deleting
 * - Features with children CAN be archived — children visually reconnect to
 *   the repository on the canvas but the parent-child relationship is preserved
 *   in the database and restored when "Show Archived" is enabled
 * - The current lifecycle is preserved in previousLifecycle for unarchive restoration
 * - No git operations or agent cancellations are triggered (archive is non-destructive)
