## Quick Reference

### Architecture Layers

```
Presentation → Application → Domain ← Infrastructure
     ↓              ↓          ↑           ↑
   CLI/Web      Use Cases   Entities   Repositories
```

### Key Principles

1. **Dependency Inversion** - High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
2. **Single Responsibility** - Each component has one reason to change
3. **Interface Segregation** - Many specific interfaces over one general-purpose
4. **Open/Closed** - Open for extension, closed for modification

## Getting Started

New contributors should read:

1. [overview.md](./overview.md) - Understand the big picture
2. [clean-architecture.md](./clean-architecture.md) - Learn the layer structure
3. Specific pattern docs as needed

## Maintaining This Directory

**Update when:**

- New architectural patterns are introduced
- Major refactoring occurs
- New subsystems are added

**File naming:**

- Use kebab-case
- Be descriptive but concise
- Suffix with `.md`

**Cross-references:**

- Link to related docs in other directories
- Keep links relative
- Verify links after moves/renames
