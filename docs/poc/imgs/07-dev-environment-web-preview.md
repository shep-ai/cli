## Summary

The **Development Environment** window for the "Dark Mode Support" feature, showing the **Web Preview** tab. This is a dedicated dev workspace launched from a feature card.

## Key Elements

- **Window title bar**: "Dark Mode Support - Development Environment" with macOS-style traffic lights
- **Tab bar**: Web Preview (active), VS Code, Terminal
- **Context bar**: Shows git branch `feat/dark-mode-support`, worktree path `.worktrees/feat/dark-mode-support`, and a **PR #237** badge with git stats (+3, -1, 5 files)
- **URL bar**: `http://localhost:9760` with an "Open in Browser" button
- **Web Preview content**: A centered placeholder showing a globe icon, "Web Preview" heading, "Your application is running on localhost:3000" message, and a green "Server Running" status badge
- This demonstrates the integrated development environment concept where each feature gets its own isolated workspace with web preview, code editing, and terminal access
