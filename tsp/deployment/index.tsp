 *
 * Index module that re-exports all deployment-related types from the deployment layer.

 *
 * ### Entities
 * - **Deployment**: A running deployment instance with state and network config
 * - **DeploySkill**: Configuration blueprint for how to deploy an application
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Import this index to access all deployment types:
 *
 * ```typespec
 * import "./deployment/index.tsp";
 *
 * op deployApplication(skill: DeploySkill): Deployment;
 * op stopDeployment(id: UUID): Deployment;
 * ```
 *
 * ## Architecture
 *

 *       |
 *       | creates
