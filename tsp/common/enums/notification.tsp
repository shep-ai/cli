/**
 * @module Shep.Common.Enums.Notification
 *
 * Defines enums for the agent notification subsystem. These enums classify
 * the types of agent lifecycle events that trigger notifications and the
 * severity levels used for rendering (toast color, icon, urgency).
 *
 * ## Notification Events
 *
 * Notifications are emitted for a curated set of meaningful agent lifecycle
 * transitions: started, phase completed, waiting for approval, completed,
 * and failed. Intermediate heartbeats and user-initiated states (cancelled)
 * are excluded to avoid noise.
 *
 * ## Severity Mapping
 *
 * | Event              | Severity |
 * |--------------------|----------|
 * | Agent Started      | info     |
 * | Phase Completed    | info     |
 * | Waiting Approval   | warning  |
 * | Agent Completed    | success  |
 * | Agent Failed       | error    |
 * | PR Merged          | success  |
 * | PR Closed          | warning  |
 * | PR Checks Passed   | success  |
 * | PR Checks Failed   | error    |
