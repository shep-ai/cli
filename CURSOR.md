# Cursor

This project provides Cursor with the same guidance as CLAUDE.md via **rules** instead of a single markdown file.

- **Project context**: [.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc](.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc) — always-applied rule with overview, architecture, commands, TDD, TypeSpec, and conventions.
- **Skills**: [.cursor/skills/](.cursor/skills/) — shep-kit and other agent skills.

When working in Cursor, the project-context rule is applied automatically. For full narrative detail (e.g. dependency lifecycle, exact command lists), see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
