/**
 * Web E2E Tests Placeholder
 *
 * This file ensures the Web E2E test directory is recognized by Vitest.
 * Actual Web E2E tests will use Playwright and live in *.spec.ts files.
 *
 * Future tests will cover:
 * - Page navigation
 * - User authentication flows
 * - Feature management UI
 * - Dashboard interactions
 * - API integration
 *
 * Note: Web E2E tests use Playwright (test:e2e:web script).
 * This placeholder uses Vitest for CI compatibility until Playwright is set up.
