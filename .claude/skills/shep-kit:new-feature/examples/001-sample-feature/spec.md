# Feature: user-authentication

> Add secure user authentication with OAuth2 providers

## Status

- **Number:** 001
- **Created:** 2026-02-02
- **Branch:** feat/001-user-authentication
- **Phase:** Requirements

## Problem Statement

Users currently cannot authenticate to the system. We need secure login/logout functionality supporting multiple OAuth2 providers (Google, GitHub) to enable personalized features and data persistence.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can sign in via Google OAuth2
- [ ] Users can sign in via GitHub OAuth2
- [ ] Session persists across browser refreshes
- [ ] Users can sign out and session is invalidated
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login when unauthenticated

## Affected Areas

| Area                           | Impact | Reasoning                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `src/presentation/web/`        | High   | New auth pages, protected route wrapper     |
| `src/infrastructure/services/` | High   | OAuth2 integration, session management      |
| `src/domain/entities/`         | Medium | New User entity                             |
| `src/application/use-cases/`   | Medium | Login, logout, session validation use cases |

## Dependencies

None identified. This is a foundational feature.

## Size Estimate

**M** - Standard OAuth2 integration with 3-4 new files per layer, well-understood patterns.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we support email/password auth in addition to OAuth2?
- [ ] What user data should we store locally vs. fetch from provider?
