# Trivy Ignore File
# =================
# CVEs listed here are suppressed from Trivy scans.
# Only add CVEs after security review confirms they are acceptable risks.

# Node.js base image bundled npm packages
# These vulnerabilities are in npm's internal bundled dependencies (glob, tar)
# within the node:22-alpine base image. Since npm is not used at runtime
# (only node executes the CLI), these do not affect the application.
# Will be automatically fixed when Node.js releases a patched base image.

# glob command injection via malicious filenames (in npm's bundled glob)
CVE-2025-64756

# node-tar arbitrary file overwrite vulnerabilities (in npm's bundled tar)
CVE-2026-23745
CVE-2026-23950
CVE-2026-24842
CVE-2026-26960

# npm CLI local privilege escalation vulnerability
# This is a local-only vulnerability requiring system access, not applicable
# in our containerized runtime environment. No fix available yet.
# Tracking: Remove once npm releases a patched version
CVE-2026-0775

# minimatch ReDoS vulnerability (Regular Expression Denial of Service)
# Minimatch 10.2.1+ fixes this, but is incompatible with eslint-plugin-react 7.37.5
# (minimatch 10.x uses named exports, not default export).
# Using minimatch 7.4.6 as temporary workaround.
# Risk is LOW: Requires malicious glob patterns in eslint config or source code.
# Tracking: Remove once eslint-plugin-react supports minimatch 10.x
