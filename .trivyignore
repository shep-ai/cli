# Only add CVEs after security review confirms they are acceptable risks.

# Node.js base image bundled npm packages
# These vulnerabilities are in npm's internal bundled dependencies (glob, tar)
# within the node:22-alpine base image. Since npm is not used at runtime
# (only node executes the CLI), these do not affect the application.
# Will be automatically fixed when Node.js releases a patched base image.

# glob command injection via malicious filenames (in npm's bundled glob)
