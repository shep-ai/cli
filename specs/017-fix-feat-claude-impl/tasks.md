- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Updated:** 2026-02-15

## Task List

### Phase 1: Foundation

- [ ] {{TASK_1_DESCRIPTION}}
- [ ] {{TASK_2_DESCRIPTION}}

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (TDD Cycle)

**RED (Write Failing Tests First):**

- [ ] Write unit tests for {{FEATURE}}

**GREEN (Implement to Pass Tests):**

- [ ] Implement {{FEATURE}}

**REFACTOR (Clean Up):**

- [ ] Extract helpers and improve code quality

## TDD Notes

- **MANDATORY**: All phases with code follow RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR
- **RED**: Write failing tests FIRST (never skip this!)
- **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass tests
- **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green

## Progress Tracking (CRITICAL)

- **Update checkboxes FREQUENTLY** - as soon as each item is complete!
- **Don't batch updates** - check off items immediately, not at the end
- **Commit task.md updates** along with code changes to show progress
