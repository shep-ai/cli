# Feature: add-dashboard-page

> Web UI dashboard page for visualizing project and feature status

## Status

- **Number:** 011
- **Created:** 2026-02-08
- **Branch:** feat/add-dashboard-page
- **Phase:** Planning

## Problem Statement

Users need a visual dashboard to see at-a-glance status of features, tasks, and SDLC lifecycle progress. Currently, there's no centralized view in the web UI to understand project health and feature progression.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Dashboard accessible as default landing page (/) in Next.js app
- [ ] Displays feature list with lifecycle phase indicators (color-coded/grouped)
- [ ] Shows task progress metrics (completed/total, WIP count)
- [ ] Displays recent activity timeline (commits, phase transitions, updates)
- [ ] Shows agent activity logs (recent AI agent actions and decisions)
- [ ] Implements filtering by lifecycle phase (Requirements, Research, Implementation, etc.)
- [ ] Auto-refreshes data via polling (configurable interval)
- [ ] Implements responsive layout using shadcn/ui components
- [ ] Follows existing Web Interface Guidelines and design system

## Affected Areas

| Area             | Impact | Reasoning                                      |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Web UI (Next.js) | HIGH   | New route, components, and data fetching logic |
| Domain/Use Cases | MEDIUM | May need use cases for dashboard data queries  |
| Storybook        | MEDIUM | Dashboard components should have stories       |
| E2E Tests        | LOW    | Playwright tests for dashboard page flow       |

## Dependencies

None identified.

## Size Estimate

**MEDIUM** - Requires new Next.js page, multiple reusable components (feature cards, progress indicators, status badges), integration with existing domain models, Storybook stories, and basic E2E tests. Estimated 3-5 tasks across UI components, data fetching, and testing.

## Open Questions

All questions resolved. Key decisions:

- [x] **Route:** Default landing page (/) - Dashboard is the first thing users see
- [x] **Metrics:** Display feature list with lifecycle phases, task progress (completed/total), recent activity timeline, and agent activity logs
- [x] **Filtering:** Yes - filter features by lifecycle phase (Requirements, Research, Implementation, etc.)
- [x] **Updates:** Polling (refresh every N seconds) for automatic data updates
