# Feature: add-dashboard-page

> Web UI dashboard page for visualizing project and feature status

## Status

- **Number:** 011
- **Created:** 2026-02-08
- **Branch:** feat/add-dashboard-page
- **Phase:** Requirements

## Problem Statement

Users need a visual dashboard to see at-a-glance status of features, tasks, and SDLC lifecycle progress. Currently, there's no centralized view in the web UI to understand project health and feature progression.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Dashboard route accessible at `/dashboard` in Next.js app
- [ ] Displays feature list with lifecycle phase indicators
- [ ] Shows task progress metrics (completed/total, WIP count)
- [ ] Implements responsive layout using shadcn/ui components
- [ ] Follows existing Web Interface Guidelines and design system

## Affected Areas

| Area             | Impact | Reasoning                                      |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Web UI (Next.js) | HIGH   | New route, components, and data fetching logic |
| Domain/Use Cases | MEDIUM | May need use cases for dashboard data queries  |
| Storybook        | MEDIUM | Dashboard components should have stories       |
| E2E Tests        | LOW    | Playwright tests for dashboard page flow       |

## Dependencies

None identified.

## Size Estimate

**MEDIUM** - Requires new Next.js page, multiple reusable components (feature cards, progress indicators, status badges), integration with existing domain models, Storybook stories, and basic E2E tests. Estimated 3-5 tasks across UI components, data fetching, and testing.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should the dashboard be the default landing page (/) or separate route (/dashboard)?
- [ ] What specific metrics should be displayed (e.g., velocity, cycle time, agent activity)?
- [ ] Should the dashboard support filtering/sorting features by lifecycle phase or status?
- [ ] Real-time updates via polling/websockets or static on page load?
