# Feature: semantic-release-cicd

> Automated npm publishing with semantic versioning via conventional commits

## Status

- **Number:** 002
- **Created:** 2026-02-02
- **Branch:** feat/002-semantic-release-cicd
- **Phase:** Requirements

## Problem Statement

The project uses conventional commits (enforced by commitlint) but has no automated release process. Currently:

- Version bumps require manual `package.json` edits
- No automated publishing to any registry
- Release notes must be written manually
- Contributors can't easily install `@shepai/cli` from a registry

## Success Criteria

- [x] semantic-release configured with conventional commits preset
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow triggers on every main branch push
- [x] Automatic version bump (patch/minor/major) based on commit types
- [x] Package published to public npm registry (`registry.npmjs.org`)
- [x] GitHub Release created with auto-generated changelog
- [x] `package.json` version updated and committed back

## Affected Areas

| Area                                | Impact | Reasoning                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `.github/workflows/`                | High   | New `release.yml` workflow         |
| `package.json`                      | Medium | Add semantic-release + plugins     |
| `.releaserc` or `release.config.js` | High   | New semantic-release configuration |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md`                   | Low    | Document release process           |

## Dependencies

None identified. Builds on existing commitlint/conventional commits setup.

## Size Estimate

**M** - Configuration and workflow files, no application code changes.

## Decisions

- **Registries:** Publish to public npm registry only
- **Trigger:** Every push to main branch (not tag-based)
- **Pre-releases:** None - only stable releases from main
