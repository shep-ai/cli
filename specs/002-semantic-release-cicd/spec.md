# Feature: semantic-release-cicd

> Automated npm publishing to GitHub and npm registries with semantic versioning via conventional commits

## Status

- **Number:** 002
- **Created:** 2026-02-02
- **Branch:** feat/002-semantic-release-cicd
- **Phase:** Requirements

## Problem Statement

The project uses conventional commits (enforced by commitlint) but has no automated release process. Currently:

- Version bumps require manual `package.json` edits
- No automated publishing to any registry
- Release notes must be written manually
- Contributors can't easily install `@shep-ai/cli` from a registry

## Success Criteria

- [ ] semantic-release configured with conventional commits preset
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow triggers on every main branch push
- [ ] Automatic version bump (patch/minor/major) based on commit types
- [ ] Package published to GitHub Package Registry (`npm.pkg.github.com`)
- [ ] Package published to public npm registry (`registry.npmjs.org`)
- [ ] GitHub Release created with auto-generated changelog
- [ ] `package.json` version updated and committed back

## Affected Areas

| Area                                | Impact | Reasoning                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `.github/workflows/`                | High   | New `release.yml` workflow                        |
| `package.json`                      | Medium | Add semantic-release + plugins, add publishConfig |
| `.releaserc` or `release.config.js` | High   | New semantic-release configuration                |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md`                   | Low    | Document release process                          |

## Dependencies

None identified. Builds on existing commitlint/conventional commits setup.

## Size Estimate

**M** - Configuration and workflow files, no application code changes. Moderate complexity due to semantic-release plugin configuration and dual registry publishing.

## Decisions

- **Registries:** Publish to both GitHub Package Registry AND public npm registry
- **Trigger:** Every push to main branch (not tag-based)
- **Pre-releases:** None - only stable releases from main
