# Feature: agent-memory-layer

> Implement persistent memory layer for AI agents using GraphZep (TypeScript temporal knowledge graph system)

## Status

- **Number:** 011
- **Created:** 2026-02-09
- **Branch:** feat/agent-memory-layer
- **Phase:** Research

## Problem Statement

Our agents currently lack persistent memory across sessions. They cannot learn from past interactions, remember user preferences, or build contextual understanding over time. This limits their effectiveness and forces users to repeat information.

We need a memory layer that:

- Persists agent interactions and learnings across sessions
- Enables contextual recall based on current conversation
- Supports graph-based relationships between memories
- Integrates with our existing agent architecture (LangGraph-based)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Graphiti library integrated as a dependency
- [ ] Memory persistence working for agent interactions
- [ ] Agents can retrieve relevant past context during conversations
- [ ] Memory graph visualization available (if Graphiti provides it)
- [ ] Clean Architecture compliance (memory as infrastructure layer)
- [ ] Unit and integration tests covering memory operations

## Affected Areas

| Area                        | Impact | Reasoning                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| infrastructure/services     | High   | New memory service implementing graph-based storage                    |
| application/ports           | Medium | New IMemoryService port interface for agent memory operations          |
| infrastructure/di/container | Medium | Register memory service in DI container                                |
| domain/generated            | Low    | May need new TypeSpec models for memory entities (Episode, Node, Edge) |
| infrastructure/agents       | High   | Integrate memory into agent execution loop (StateGraph nodes)          |

## Dependencies

None identified.

## Size Estimate

**Large** - Requires:

- Research on Graphiti API and best practices
- TypeSpec domain modeling for memory entities
- New infrastructure service with graph database integration
- Integration with existing LangGraph agent system
- Comprehensive testing strategy (unit + integration)
- Documentation for memory operations

Estimated 5-8 implementation tasks over multiple development sessions.

## Open Questions

**Resolved:**

- [x] **Memory Scope:** Hybrid approach - some memories global (user preferences, patterns), some feature-specific (task details)

**To be answered during research:**

- [ ] Does Graphiti require a separate database or use SQLite? _(Research will evaluate compatibility)_
- [ ] How does Graphiti handle memory retrieval (semantic search, graph traversal)? _(Research will assess retrieval APIs)_
- [ ] What are the performance implications for large memory graphs? _(Research will benchmark and establish targets)_
- [ ] What configuration options does Graphiti expose (embedding models, graph parameters)? _(Research will document available options)_
