  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Planning
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-16

  ## Architecture Overview

  ```
  {{ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM}}
  ```

  ## Implementation Strategy

  **MANDATORY TDD**: All phases with executable code follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles.

  High-level walkthrough of how the phases connect and why they are ordered
  this way. Focus on architectural decisions and data flow — not individual
  task descriptions (see tasks.yaml for the detailed breakdown).
