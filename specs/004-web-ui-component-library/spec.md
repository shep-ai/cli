# Feature: web-ui-component-library

> Establish component library foundation with shadcn/ui, Storybook, and design system

## Status

- **Number:** 004
- **Created:** 2026-02-03
- **Branch:** feat/004-web-ui-component-library
- **Phase:** Requirements

## Problem Statement

The web UI presentation layer (`src/presentation/web/`) doesn't exist yet. While package.json has scripts for Next.js and Storybook, the actual dependencies, configurations, and component infrastructure are missing. Without a component library foundation:

- No reusable UI components for building web interfaces
- No design system for consistent styling and theming
- No component documentation via Storybook
- No way to build web-based interfaces for the Shep AI platform

This feature establishes the foundational component library using shadcn/ui (Radix primitives + Tailwind) with Storybook for documentation.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Next.js 14+ installed and configured with App Router
- [ ] shadcn/ui CLI installed and initialized
- [ ] Tailwind CSS configured with design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, shadows)
- [ ] **Dark mode support configured from the start** (Tailwind dark mode + theme tokens)
- [ ] Storybook 8+ configured for React/Next.js components (local development only)
- [ ] Core shadcn/ui components installed: Button, Card, Input, Label, Select, Dialog
- [ ] Additional components installed: Badge, Alert, Tabs, Accordion, Toast, Popover
- [ ] Each component has Storybook stories with all variants (light + dark mode)
- [ ] Design tokens documented in Storybook (colors, spacing, typography, shadows)
- [ ] `src/presentation/web/` directory structure follows Clean Architecture
- [ ] Component tests written following TDD principles (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- [ ] Playwright E2E test setup verified for web components

| Area                        | Impact | Reasoning                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/presentation/web/`     | High   | New directory - entire web UI layer foundation     |
| `package.json`              | High   | Add Next.js, shadcn/ui, Storybook, Tailwind deps   |
| `.storybook/`               | High   | New directory - Storybook configuration            |
| `tailwind.config.ts`        | High   | New file - Tailwind with dark mode + design tokens |
| `postcss.config.js`         | Medium | New file - PostCSS for Tailwind                    |
| `components.json`           | Medium | New file - shadcn/ui configuration                 |
| `src/presentation/web/lib/` | Medium | Utility functions (cn helper, theme utilities)     |
| `tests/unit/presentation/`  | Medium | New test directory for component unit tests        |
| `tests/e2e/web/`            | Medium | E2E test directory for web UI (Playwright)         |
| `tsconfig.json`             | Low    | Add paths for @/components and @/lib aliases       |
| `eslint.config.mjs`         | Low    | Add React/Next.js ESLint rules                     |
| `.prettierrc`               | Low    | Add Tailwind Prettier plugin                       |
| `docs/development/`         | Low    | Document component library usage and design system |

## Dependencies

None identified. This is foundational infrastructure with no feature dependencies.

## Size Estimate

**L** - Large feature requiring:

- Multiple tool installations (Next.js, Storybook, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
- New directory structure following Clean Architecture
- Design token system with light + dark mode themes
- 12 components total (6 core + 6 additional) with Storybook stories
- Component testing infrastructure following TDD
- Dark mode configuration across all tools
- Comprehensive documentation

This establishes the foundation for all future web UI work.

## Open Questions

None - requirements are clear after user decisions:

- ✅ Dark mode: Yes, configured from the start
- ✅ Component set: Core 6 + Badge, Alert, Tabs, Accordion, Toast, Popover
- ✅ Storybook deployment: Local development only
