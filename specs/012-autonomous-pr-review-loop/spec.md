## Problem Statement

Today, `/shep-kit:commit-pr` creates a PR, watches CI until green, and stops.
But the repo has a Claude Code review bot (`claude-code-review.yml`) that
automatically reviews every PR. When that bot leaves comments requesting
changes, a human must manually read the feedback, apply fixes, and push —
breaking the autonomous flow.

This feature extends the commit-pr skill to **automatically watch for bot
review comments, parse the feedback, apply fixes, push, and loop** until the
bot has no remaining issues. The result is a fully autonomous path from
implementation to PR approval.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] After CI passes, the skill polls for Claude Code bot review comments on the PR
- [ ] Bot review comments are parsed into actionable items (file, line, suggested change)
- [ ] The skill applies fixes locally based on parsed feedback
- [ ] Fixed code is committed and pushed with a descriptive conventional commit message
- [ ] The skill re-watches CI after each push (reusing existing CI watch loop)
- [ ] The cycle repeats until the bot leaves no actionable feedback or approves
- [ ] A configurable maximum iteration count prevents infinite loops (default: 5)
- [ ] feature.yaml is updated with review loop state (iteration count, status)
- [ ] The skill gracefully handles edge cases: no bot review, timeout, non-actionable comments
- [ ] Existing commit-pr behavior is preserved — the review loop is an additive extension

## Affected Areas

| Area                                         | Impact | Reasoning                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.claude/skills/shep-kit:commit-pr/SKILL.md` | High   | Core skill file being extended with the review loop workflow |
| `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`   | Low    | Read-only — we consume its output, no changes needed         |
| `docs/development/feature-yaml-protocol.md`  | Medium | Document new review-loop checkpoints and phase transitions   |
| `docs/development/spec-driven-workflow.md`   | Low    | Update commit-pr section to mention review loop              |

## Dependencies

- Claude Code review bot must be configured and running on the repo (already in place via `claude-code-review.yml`)
- `gh` CLI must be authenticated with permissions to read PR reviews and comments
- The bot must post review comments in a parseable format (standard GitHub review comments)

## Size Estimate

**M** - The core implementation is extending an existing SKILL.md with a new
watch-parse-fix-push loop. No new TypeScript code or domain models are needed.
The work is primarily in the skill definition (shell commands via `gh api`),
feature.yaml protocol updates, and documentation. Medium because the parsing
and fix-application logic requires careful prompt engineering in the skill
instructions.
