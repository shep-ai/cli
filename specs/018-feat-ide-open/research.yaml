# Structured technology decisions
decisions:
  - title: Command pattern — dedicated use case vs direct UpdateSettingsUseCase
    chosen: Direct UpdateSettingsUseCase with settings mutation in command
    rejected:
      - Dedicated ConfigureIdeUseCase (like ConfigureAgentUseCase)
    rationale: >
      The agent command uses a dedicated ConfigureAgentUseCase because it has
      complex validation (agent type enum, auth method combinations, token
      presence). IDE selection is trivial — just setting a string field.
      A dedicated use case would be over-engineering. Follow the KISS principle:
      mutate the settings object in the command handler, call
      UpdateSettingsUseCase.execute(), and refresh the singleton.

  - title: IDE binary validation approach
    chosen: 'Non-blocking PATH check with warning via execFileNoThrow'
    rejected:
      - Blocking validation (reject save if binary not found)
      - No validation at all
    rationale: >
      Users may configure their IDE before installing it, or the binary may be
      in a non-standard location. Blocking would frustrate users. No validation
      gives no feedback. A warning strikes the right balance: inform but don't
      block. Use the project's execFileNoThrow utility for safe PATH checking.

  - title: Supported IDE list
    chosen: 'vscode, cursor, windsurf, zed (extensible string, not enum)'
    rejected:
      - Hardcoded enum in TypeSpec
    rationale: >
      The existing TypeSpec model defines defaultEditor as `string`, not an
      enum. This is intentional — users may have other editors. The CLI command
      offers known IDEs as select options but also accepts any string via the
      --editor flag. No TypeSpec changes needed.

  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Research
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-15

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. Command Pattern — Dedicated Use Case vs Direct UpdateSettingsUseCase

  **Options considered:**

  1. **Dedicated ConfigureIdeUseCase** — Like ConfigureAgentUseCase, with validation logic
  2. **Direct UpdateSettingsUseCase** — Mutate settings in command handler, persist via generic use case

  **Decision:** Direct UpdateSettingsUseCase

  **Rationale:** Agent configuration has complex validation (enum types, auth method combos, token presence), justifying a dedicated use case. IDE selection is a single string field — a dedicated use case would be over-engineering. Mutate the settings object, call `UpdateSettingsUseCase.execute()`, refresh the in-memory singleton via `resetSettings()` + `initializeSettings()`.

  ### 2. IDE Binary Validation Approach

  **Options considered:**

  1. **Blocking validation** — Reject save if IDE binary not found in PATH
  2. **Non-blocking warning** — Save anyway, show warning if binary not found
  3. **No validation** — Just save the value

  **Decision:** Non-blocking PATH check with warning

  **Rationale:** Users may configure an IDE before installing it, or the binary may exist in a non-standard PATH. Blocking frustrates users. No feedback is unhelpful. Warning is the right balance.

  **Implementation:** Use project's `execFileNoThrow` utility (safe, no shell injection) to check PATH availability via `which`. Map editor names to binaries:

  | Editor   | Binary     |
  | -------- | ---------- |
  | vscode   | `code`     |
  | cursor   | `cursor`   |
  | windsurf | `windsurf` |
  | zed      | `zed`      |

  ### 3. Supported IDE List

  **Options considered:**

  1. **Hardcoded TypeSpec enum** — Restrict to known values
  2. **String with known options** — CLI offers select menu, --editor accepts any string

  **Decision:** String with known options (no TypeSpec changes)

  **Rationale:** `defaultEditor` is already `string` in TypeSpec. Users may have other editors. The interactive prompt offers known options, but `--editor` accepts any string for flexibility.

  ## Architecture

  ### File Structure (new files only)

  ```
  src/presentation/
  ├── cli/commands/settings/
  │   └── ide.command.ts              # New: shep settings ide command
  └── tui/prompts/
      └── ide-select.prompt.ts        # New: IDE selection prompt config
  ```

  ### Flow

  ```
  User runs `shep settings ide`
    -> Interactive: TUI select prompt (vscode/cursor/windsurf/zed)
    -> Non-interactive: --editor flag value
    -> Validate binary in PATH (warn if not found, using execFileNoThrow)
    -> getSettings() -> mutate environment.defaultEditor
    -> UpdateSettingsUseCase.execute(settings)
    -> resetSettings() + initializeSettings(updatedSettings)
    -> Success message
  ```

  ### Pattern Reference

  Follows the exact pattern of `agent.command.ts`:
  - Interactive wizard vs non-interactive flags
  - Resolve use case from container
  - Update in-memory singleton after persistence
  - Graceful Ctrl+C handling

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library            | Version  | Purpose                    | Pros                       | Cons         |
  | ------------------ | -------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ |
  | @inquirer/prompts  | existing | Interactive IDE selection   | Already used, TypeScript   | None         |
  | commander          | existing | CLI flag parsing           | Already used               | None         |
  | execFileNoThrow    | internal | PATH validation via which  | Safe, no shell injection   | None         |

  ## Security Considerations

  - Use `execFileNoThrow('which', [binary])` — safe against command injection
  - No user input is passed to shell execution (binary names are from a known map)

  ## Performance Implications

  No performance implications. Single `which` call is negligible.

  ## Open Questions

  All questions resolved.
