oneLiner: Interactive orchestrator wrapping FeaturesCanvas with toolbar and state management
summary: >
  Build a Control Center Tier 3 component that wraps the existing FeaturesCanvas
  with interactive capabilities: node selection with visual highlight, toolbar with
  canvas actions (add feature, auto-layout), and centralized state management via
  a custom hook. Uses React Flow's built-in Panel component for overlay toolbar.
  FeaturesCanvas stays pure/dumb; Control Center adds all interactivity.

  ## Problem Statement

  The FeaturesCanvas (015) renders feature nodes on a React Flow graph but is
  purely presentational — it has no selection state, no detail views, no toolbar,
  and no way for users to interact beyond basic pan/zoom. The web UI needs an
  interactive Control Center that wraps the canvas and adds the orchestration
  layer: selecting nodes with visual highlight, toolbar actions for managing
  features, and keyboard shortcuts for power users.

  ## Architecture

  ```
  Tier 3: features/control-center/     ← NEW orchestrator
              ├── composes FeaturesCanvas (canvas layer)
              ├── adds panels/toolbars (UI overlay layer)
              └── manages state + interactions (logic layer)

  Tier 3: features/features-canvas/    ← EXISTING (stays pure/dumb)
  Tier 1: common/feature-node/         ← EXISTING nodes
  ```

  Key principle: Keep FeaturesCanvas as a pure presentation component. Build the
  Control Center as a new Tier 3 component that wraps it and adds interactivity.

  ### Layout

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ [Toolbar Panel - top-left]              │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │                                         │
  │   FeaturesCanvas                        │
  │   (React Flow)                          │
  │                                         │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  Toolbar uses React Flow's `<Panel>` component for positioning on top of
  the canvas without interfering with pan/zoom.

  ## Components

  ### File Structure

  ```
  features/control-center/
  ├── control-center.tsx              ← Main orchestrator component
  ├── use-control-center-state.ts     ← Custom hook: selection, keyboard
  ├── control-center-toolbar.tsx      ← Top toolbar (add, layout)
  ├── control-center.stories.tsx
  └── index.ts
  ```

  ### ControlCenter (orchestrator)

  - Renders FeaturesCanvas inside a ReactFlowProvider
  - Uses `useControlCenterState` hook for all state management
  - Passes interaction callbacks (onNodeClick, onPaneClick, onConnect) to canvas
  - Renders Panel overlays for toolbar and status bar

  ### useControlCenterState (custom hook)

  Owns:
  - Node/edge state (React Flow's `useNodesState`/`useEdgesState`)
  - Selected node tracking
  - Action handlers (add, delete, connect, etc.)

  ### ControlCenterToolbar (top panel)

  - Add feature button
  - Auto-layout button
  - Filter/search (stretch goal)

  ## Interaction Layers

  | Interaction        | Mechanism                                        |
  | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
  | Select node        | `onNodeClick` → highlight node                   |
  | Deselect           | `onPaneClick` → clear selection                  |
  | Canvas actions     | Toolbar buttons (add feature, auto-layout)       |
  | Keyboard shortcuts | `useKeyboard` hook for Escape (deselect)         |

  ## Changes to Existing Components

  | Component        | Change                                                      |
  | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
  | FeaturesCanvas   | Extend props — expose onNodeClick, onPaneClick, onConnect   |
  | FeatureNode      | Add selected/highlighted visual state (ring or border glow) |
  | RepositoryNode   | No change                                                   |
  | ControlCenter    | New — wraps everything                                      |
  | Toolbar          | New — built inside control-center/                          |

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] `ControlCenter` component in `features/control-center/`
  - [ ] `useControlCenterState` hook managing all interactive state
  - [ ] Toolbar panel (top) with add-feature button
  - [ ] Node selection: click to select, click canvas to deselect
  - [ ] Selected node visual highlight (ring/glow on FeatureNode)
  - [ ] FeaturesCanvas props extended with onNodeClick, onPaneClick
  - [ ] Keyboard shortcut: Escape to deselect
  - [ ] Storybook stories: Empty, WithFeatures, WithToolbar
  - [ ] `pnpm build:storybook` passes
  - [ ] `pnpm build:web` passes
  - [ ] Components follow tier import rules (013-ui-arch)

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area                                            | Impact | Reasoning                                  |
  | ----------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
  | `src/presentation/web/components/features/`     | High   | New control-center component directory     |
  | `src/presentation/web/components/features/features-canvas/` | Medium | Extend props for interaction callbacks |
  | `src/presentation/web/components/common/feature-node/` | Low | Add selected visual state                 |

  ## Dependencies

  - **015-feature-flow-canvas** (Complete): FeaturesCanvas and node components
  - **013-ui-arch** (Complete): Four-tier component hierarchy
  - **014-ui-sidebar** (Complete): Sidebar navigation context

  ## Scope Boundaries

  **In scope:**
  - ControlCenter orchestrator wrapping FeaturesCanvas
  - State management hook (useControlCenterState)
  - Toolbar via React Flow Panel
  - Node selection with visual highlight
  - Keyboard shortcut (Escape to deselect)
  - Storybook stories with mock data
  - Extending FeaturesCanvas/FeatureNode props as needed

  **Out of scope:**
  - Backend API integration for feature data
  - Real-time updates or WebSocket integration
  - Drag-and-drop node creation or edge creation
  - Auto-layout algorithm implementation (button placeholder only)
  - Node context menu (stretch goal for future)
  - Filter/search in toolbar (stretch goal for future)

  ## Size Estimate

  **M** - Creates a new orchestrator component with 3 files (component, hook,
  toolbar), modifies 2 existing components (FeaturesCanvas props, FeatureNode
  selected state), and requires comprehensive Storybook stories. Moderate
  complexity from React Flow Panel integration and state management.
