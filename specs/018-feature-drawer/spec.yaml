oneLiner: Sliding drawer panel to display feature details when a feature node is selected on the canvas
summary: >
  Add a feature drawer component extending the shadcn/ui Drawer (built on Vaul) that slides open
  from the right when a user clicks a feature node on the ReactFlow canvas. The drawer displays
  feature details (name, description, lifecycle phase, state, progress) and provides a structured
  panel for future feature management actions. The selectedNode state already exists in
  useControlCenterState but is not yet rendered — this feature connects it to a visible UI.

# Open questions — all resolved with AI-recommended defaults
openQuestions:
  - question: 'Should the drawer use Vaul (shadcn Drawer) or Radix Dialog (existing Sheet component)?'
    resolved: true
    answer: >
      Use the shadcn Drawer (Vaul) as specified in the feature name. Install vaul as a dependency
      and add the shadcn drawer.tsx UI component. This gives us mobile-friendly swipe gestures and
      snap points for free, which will be useful as the drawer content grows. The Sheet is
      Radix Dialog-based and lacks touch/swipe interactions. Alternative: use the existing Sheet
      if minimizing new dependencies is a higher priority than mobile UX.

  - question: 'What content should the drawer display for a selected feature?'
    resolved: true
    answer: >
      Display all available FeatureNodeData fields organized into three sections: (1) Header —
      feature name and featureId; (2) Status — lifecycle phase label, state badge with icon/color
      from featureNodeStateConfig, and progress bar when applicable; (3) Details — description,
      agent name, runtime, blocked-by info, and error message. Fields that are undefined/null
      should be gracefully hidden rather than showing empty placeholders. This covers the full
      data contract and can be extended later with action buttons.

  - question: "Should the drawer direction be 'right' (side panel) or 'bottom' (mobile-style)?"
    resolved: true
    answer: >
      Use direction='right' for the drawer since this is primarily a desktop canvas application.
      The canvas occupies the full viewport and a right-side detail panel is the standard UX pattern
      for inspector/property panels in visual editors (Figma, Miro, etc.). Alternative: use
      direction='bottom' if the app pivots toward mobile-first usage.

  - question: 'Should the drawer have an overlay that dims the canvas behind it?'
    resolved: true
    answer: >
      No overlay. The drawer should slide in without dimming the canvas. Users need to see the
      canvas context while inspecting a feature's details — this is an inspector panel, not a
      modal dialog. The canvas should remain visible and interactive (panning/zooming) while the
      drawer is open. Clicking the canvas pane should close the drawer (already handled by
      clearSelection via onPaneClick).

  - question: 'What width should the drawer be?'
    resolved: true
    answer: >
      Use a fixed width of 384px (w-96 in Tailwind, 24rem). This is wide enough to display
      feature details comfortably without consuming too much canvas real estate. It matches
      common inspector panel widths in visual editors. The drawer should not be resizable in
      this initial implementation. Alternative: 320px (w-80) if the canvas feels too cramped.

  - question: 'Should clicking a different feature node while the drawer is open switch the drawer content or close-then-reopen?'
    resolved: true
    answer: >
      The drawer content should update in-place when a different feature node is clicked. The
      drawer stays open and its content transitions to show the newly selected feature. This
      avoids jarring close/open animations and matches the inspector panel UX pattern. The
      existing handleNodeClick already updates selectedNode, so the drawer just re-renders
      with new data.

  - question: 'Should the drawer be accessible via keyboard navigation?'
    resolved: true
    answer: >
      Yes. The Escape key should close the drawer (already handled by clearSelection on keydown).
      The drawer content should be navigable with Tab key. The close button should be focusable.
      Vaul provides built-in accessibility features (focus trapping, ARIA attributes) that should
      be preserved. Screen readers should announce the drawer opening with the feature name.

  ## Problem Statement

  When users click a feature node on the ReactFlow canvas, there is no detail panel to inspect
  or manage the feature. The `selectedNode` state is already tracked in `useControlCenterState`
  (via `handleNodeClick` and `clearSelection`) but is not connected to any visible UI. Users
  need a sliding drawer panel that shows feature details and will eventually host feature
  management actions (edit, run agent, view logs, etc.).

  The feature node itself shows truncated information (name limited to one line, description
  to two lines). Users have no way to see full details, and the node's compact layout cannot
  accommodate the level of detail needed for feature inspection.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] Clicking a feature node on the canvas opens a right-side drawer panel
  - [ ] The drawer displays the feature's name, featureId, description, lifecycle phase, state, and progress
  - [ ] The drawer uses consistent styling from featureNodeStateConfig (colors, icons, labels)
  - [ ] The drawer closes when pressing Escape, clicking the canvas pane, or clicking the drawer's close button
  - [ ] Clicking a different feature node updates the drawer content in-place without close/reopen animation
  - [ ] The drawer does NOT overlay/dim the canvas — the canvas remains visible alongside
  - [ ] The Tier 0 shadcn/ui Drawer component (drawer.tsx) is added to components/ui/
  - [ ] The Tier 1 FeatureDrawer component is created in components/common/feature-drawer/
  - [ ] Both new components have colocated Storybook stories
  - [ ] All new components are exported from their respective barrel index files
  - [ ] Unit tests cover drawer content rendering for all feature states
  - [ ] Integration tests cover open/close/switch behavior
  - [ ] The drawer is keyboard-accessible (Escape closes, Tab navigates content)
  - [ ] vaul is added as a dependency to @shepai/web package.json
  - [ ] Dark mode is supported with correct theme colors

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1: Drawer Open on Node Click** — When a user clicks a feature node (type `featureNode`) on the ReactFlow canvas, a drawer panel slides in from the right side of the viewport. The drawer is driven by the existing `selectedNode` state from `useControlCenterState`.

  - **FR-2: Drawer Close Triggers** — The drawer closes (selectedNode set to null) when any of these occur: (a) user presses Escape key, (b) user clicks the canvas pane (empty area), (c) user clicks the drawer's close button (X). All three triggers use the existing `clearSelection` function.

  - **FR-3: Header Section** — The drawer header displays the feature name as the title and the featureId (e.g., `#f1`) as a subtitle or badge. The header must be visually prominent and always visible at the top of the drawer.

  - **FR-4: Status Section** — The drawer displays the feature's current status including: (a) lifecycle phase label using `lifecycleDisplayLabels` mapping (e.g., "REQUIREMENTS", "IMPLEMENTATION"), (b) state badge with icon and color from `featureNodeStateConfig` (running/action-required/done/blocked/error), (c) progress bar showing percentage (0-100) when the state config has `showProgressBar: true` or progress > 0.

  - **FR-5: Details Section** — The drawer displays additional feature details: (a) full description text (not truncated), (b) agent name if present (e.g., "Agent: Planner"), (c) runtime if present (e.g., "Runtime: 2h 15m"), (d) blocked-by feature name if state is `blocked`, (e) error message if state is `error`. Fields that are undefined/null are hidden — no empty placeholders.

  - **FR-6: In-Place Content Switch** — When the drawer is already open and the user clicks a different feature node, the drawer content updates to show the new feature's data without a close/reopen animation cycle. The drawer remains open and re-renders with the new `selectedNode` data.

  - **FR-7: No Canvas Overlay** — The drawer slides in without dimming or overlaying the canvas. The canvas remains fully visible and interactive (pan, zoom, node drag) while the drawer is open. The drawer occupies a fixed 384px width on the right side.

  - **FR-8: Drawer Integration Point** — The FeatureDrawer component is rendered inside `ControlCenterInner` as a sibling to `FeaturesCanvas`. It receives `selectedNode` and `clearSelection` as props from the `useControlCenterState` hook.

  - **FR-9: Storybook Stories** — Both the Tier 0 Drawer UI primitive and the Tier 1 FeatureDrawer component have colocated `.stories.tsx` files. Stories cover: (a) all five feature states (running, action-required, done, blocked, error), (b) all six lifecycle phases, (c) with/without optional fields (description, agentName, runtime, blockedBy, errorMessage), (d) drawer open/closed states.

  - **FR-10: Barrel Exports** — The FeatureDrawer component and its props type are exported from `components/common/index.ts` following the existing barrel export pattern.

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1: Render Performance** — The drawer open/close animation must complete in under 300ms. Switching content between features must not cause visible layout shift or flicker. The drawer must not degrade ReactFlow canvas performance (no forced re-renders of the canvas when drawer content changes).

  - **NFR-2: Accessibility** — The drawer must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards: (a) Escape key closes the drawer, (b) close button is focusable and has an accessible label, (c) drawer content is navigable via Tab key, (d) state badges and lifecycle labels have sufficient color contrast (already ensured by featureNodeStateConfig), (e) screen readers announce drawer opening. Vaul's built-in ARIA attributes must be preserved.

  - **NFR-3: Dark Mode** — The drawer must render correctly in both light and dark modes using the existing Tailwind CSS v4 theme variables (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border`, `text-muted-foreground`, etc.). No hardcoded color values.

  - **NFR-4: Responsive Layout** — The drawer width is fixed at 384px. On viewport widths below 768px, the canvas may be partially obscured — this is acceptable for the initial implementation since the app is primarily desktop-targeted. No responsive breakpoint handling required for v1.

  - **NFR-5: Component Architecture** — The drawer follows the project's four-tier component hierarchy: (a) Tier 0 `drawer.tsx` in `components/ui/` is a generic, reusable shadcn/ui primitive with no feature-specific logic, (b) Tier 1 `FeatureDrawer` in `components/common/feature-drawer/` composes the Drawer primitive with feature-specific content layout. No feature-domain logic leaks into the UI primitive.

  - **NFR-6: Testability** — The FeatureDrawer component accepts all data as props (no internal data fetching). This enables straightforward unit testing by passing mock FeatureNodeData. Test IDs or data-slot attributes should be added to key sections (header, status, details) for test selectors.

  - **NFR-7: Bundle Impact** — The vaul dependency adds approximately 3-5KB gzipped. This is acceptable for the functionality it provides. The drawer component itself should have minimal additional bundle impact by reusing existing UI primitives (Badge, Progress, etc.) from shadcn/ui.

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | Vaul Drawer vs existing Sheet? | Use Vaul Drawer | Swipe gestures, snap points, mobile-ready. Sheet is simpler but lacks touch interactions. |
  | 2 | What content to display? | All FeatureNodeData fields in 3 sections | Covers full data contract. Undefined fields are hidden. Extensible for future actions. |
  | 3 | Drawer direction? | Right side panel | Desktop canvas app standard. Inspector panel pattern (Figma, Miro, VS Code). |
  | 4 | Canvas overlay when drawer opens? | No overlay | Inspector panels don't dim content. Users need canvas context while inspecting. |
  | 5 | Drawer width? | 384px (w-96) | Standard inspector width. Balances detail space vs canvas visibility. |
  | 6 | Content switch behavior? | Update in-place | Avoids jarring close/open animation. Matches inspector panel UX. |
  | 7 | Keyboard accessibility? | Yes, full support | Escape closes, Tab navigates. Vaul provides ARIA built-in. |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | `components/ui/drawer.tsx` (NEW) | High | New Tier 0 shadcn/ui primitive wrapping Vaul. Must be added via shadcn CLI or manually. |
  | `components/common/feature-drawer/` (NEW) | High | New Tier 1 component that composes the Drawer UI primitive with feature-specific content layout (header, status, details sections). |
  | `components/features/control-center/control-center-inner.tsx` | Medium | Must integrate the feature drawer, passing `selectedNode` and `clearSelection` as props. Drawer renders as sibling to `FeaturesCanvas`. |
  | `components/features/control-center/use-control-center-state.ts` | Low | State already tracks `selectedNode`. May need minor adjustments if drawer requires additional state (e.g., explicit open/close boolean). |
  | `components/common/index.ts` | Low | Must export the new FeatureDrawer component. |
  | `package.json` (@shepai/web) | Low | Must add `vaul` as a dependency. |

  ## Dependencies

  - **vaul** (npm package): Headless drawer component for React. Required by shadcn/ui Drawer. Not yet installed — must be added to @shepai/web.
  - **Existing Sheet component** (`components/ui/sheet.tsx`): Reference for Radix-based sliding panel patterns but not directly used. Drawer is a separate primitive.
  - **FeatureNodeData interface** (`components/common/feature-node/feature-node-state-config.ts`): Data contract for what the drawer displays. Already defined with name, description, featureId, lifecycle, state, progress, runtime, blockedBy, errorMessage, agentName.
  - **featureNodeStateConfig** (`feature-node-state-config.ts`): State colors, icons, border classes, badge classes, and labels for rendering status within the drawer. Already defined for all five states.
  - **lifecycleDisplayLabels** (`feature-node-state-config.ts`): Mapping from lifecycle phase enum to display labels. Already defined for all six phases.
  - **useControlCenterState hook**: Already provides `selectedNode: FeatureNodeData | null` and `clearSelection: () => void`. The drawer consumes these directly.
  - **Existing shadcn/ui primitives**: Badge, Progress, Separator, Button — may be composed within the drawer content sections.

  ## Size Estimate

  **M** — This involves:
  1. Installing vaul dependency and adding shadcn Drawer UI primitive (~30 min)
  2. Creating FeatureDrawer common component with three content sections (~2-3 hours)
  3. Integrating into ControlCenterInner (~30 min)
  4. Writing Storybook stories for both new components (~1 hour)
  5. Writing TDD tests — RED: unit tests for content rendering across all states, integration tests for open/close/switch; GREEN: minimal passing implementation; REFACTOR: cleanup (~1-2 hours)
  6. Total: ~1-2 days of focused work

  Estimated at M (days) because while individual pieces are straightforward, the feature requires
  a new dependency, a new UI primitive, a new common component with multiple content sections,
  Storybook stories, and TDD test coverage across the stack.
