summary: >
  Implementation plan for the feature drawer — a right-side sliding inspector panel that displays
  feature details when a node is selected on the ReactFlow canvas, plus a feature creation drawer
  with native OS file picker for attachments. Phases 1-3 (complete): install vaul, create Drawer
  UI primitive, FeatureDrawer component, and integration. Phases 4-5 (new): extend the native
  dialog service to support file picking (not just folders), integrate native file picker into
  FeatureCreateDrawer so attachments include full absolute file paths, and add Playwright E2E
  test verifying the full create-feature-with-attachment flow.

    description: >
      Install vaul dependency and create the generic Drawer component in components/ui/. This
      must come first because the Tier 1 FeatureDrawer depends on it. The Drawer primitive
      follows the same pattern as the existing Sheet component (sheet.tsx) — wrapping a headless
      library with styled sub-components using data-slot attributes and cn() utility. Includes
      colocated Storybook stories covering all four directions.

    description: >
      Create the FeatureDrawer component in components/common/feature-drawer/ that composes the
      Drawer primitive with feature-specific content layout. Three sections: Header (name + ID),
      Status (lifecycle label + state badge + progress bar), Details (description + agent + runtime +
      blocked-by + error). Includes TDD unit tests for content rendering across all 5 states and 6
      lifecycle phases, barrel exports, and colocated Storybook stories.

      Wire the FeatureDrawer into ControlCenterInner as a sibling to FeaturesCanvas. Pass
      selectedNode and clearSelection from the existing useControlCenterState hook. The hook

      Extend the native OS dialog bridge (currently folder-only via FolderDialogService) to
      support file picking. Create a new FileDialogService with platform-specific commands
      (osascript choose file / zenity --file-selection / PowerShell OpenFileDialog) that returns
      absolute file paths with metadata (name, size). Create the corresponding Next.js API route
      at /api/dialog/pick-files and a client-side pickFiles() helper. This follows the same
      pattern established by the existing folder picker: infrastructure service → API route →
      client helper. All with TDD unit tests.

    description: >
      Replace the browser-native <input type="file"> in FeatureCreateDrawer with the native OS
      file picker from Phase 4. Change CreateFeatureFormData.attachments from File[] to
      FileAttachment[] (with full path, name, size). Update AttachmentCard to display the full
      absolute file path. Update icon mapping to use file extension instead of MIME type. Update
      all unit tests and Storybook stories. Write Playwright E2E test verifying the full scenario:
      navigate to control center → open create drawer → attach a file via native picker → verify
      attachment card shows full file path → submit. The E2E test uses Playwright route
      interception to mock the /api/dialog/pick-files endpoint.

  ## Architecture Overview

  The feature drawer integrates into the existing four-tier component hierarchy:

  ```
  ControlCenterInner (Tier 3 - features/)
  ├── FeaturesCanvas (Tier 3 - features/)
  │   └── FeatureNode (Tier 1 - common/)
  └── FeatureDrawer (Tier 1 - common/)    ← NEW
      └── Drawer (Tier 0 - ui/)           ← NEW
          └── Vaul primitives
  ```

  The Drawer UI primitive follows the exact pattern established by `sheet.tsx`: a headless library
  (Vaul instead of Radix Dialog) wrapped with styled sub-components. Each sub-component uses
  `data-slot` attributes for CSS targeting, `cn()` for className merging, and spreads remaining
  props. The component exports follow the named-function pattern with a barrel export at the bottom.

  The FeatureDrawer follows the same directory structure as `feature-node/` — a subdirectory
  under `components/common/` containing the component file, colocated stories, and a barrel
  `index.ts`. It is re-exported from `components/common/index.ts`.

  The integration point is `ControlCenterInner`, which already destructures `selectedNode` and
  `clearSelection` from `useControlCenterState` but currently passes neither to any visible UI.
  The drawer renders as a Vaul portal (to `document.body`) — it does not affect the FeaturesCanvas
  DOM tree or ReactFlow's viewport calculations.

  ### Data Flow

  ```
  User clicks FeatureNode on canvas
    → handleNodeClick sets selectedNode (useControlCenterState)
    → ControlCenterInner re-renders
    → FeatureDrawer receives selectedNode !== null → Drawer opens

  User clicks canvas pane / Escape / close button
    → clearSelection / onOpenChange(false) sets selectedNode to null
    → ControlCenterInner re-renders
    → FeatureDrawer receives selectedNode === null → Drawer closes

  User clicks different FeatureNode while drawer is open
    → handleNodeClick updates selectedNode with new data
    → FeatureDrawer re-renders in-place with new content (no close/reopen)
  ```

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### 1. Vaul Drawer over existing Sheet (Radix Dialog)
  The Sheet component (`sheet.tsx`) wraps Radix Dialog which is inherently modal — it traps
  focus, adds an overlay, and blocks background interaction. Achieving non-modal behavior
  requires fighting against Radix Dialog's design (removing overlay, disabling focus trap,
  preventing `pointer-events: none` on body). Vaul provides `modal={false}` natively, keeping
  the canvas fully interactive while the drawer is open. This matches the inspector panel UX
  pattern used in Figma, Miro, and VS Code. The ~3-5KB gzipped bundle cost is minimal.

  ### 2. Derived open state (no new state variable)
  The drawer's visibility is derived from `selectedNode !== null`. No additional `isDrawerOpen`
  boolean is needed. This avoids redundant state that must be kept in sync and eliminates a
  class of consistency bugs. The `onOpenChange` callback from Vaul maps directly to
  `clearSelection` via the `onClose` prop.

  ### 3. Portal rendering with fixed positioning
  Vaul renders via portal to `document.body` with `position: fixed`, overlaying the right 384px
  (w-96) of the canvas viewport. This avoids fighting Vaul's layout model and prevents ReactFlow
  viewport recalculation that would occur with a flex-sibling approach where the canvas resizes.

  ### 4. Inline progress bar (no new Progress UI component)
  The existing `feature-node.tsx` implements an inline progress bar using simple divs
  (`bg-muted` container + colored fill with `progressClass`). The drawer follows the same
  pattern for consistency. A Tier 0 Progress component can be extracted later if more consumers
  need it.

  ### 5. Three inline sections (no sub-components)
  Header, Status, and Details are rendered as inline JSX within FeatureDrawer (~80-100 lines
  total). Each section is ~15-25 lines of JSX used in one place. Splitting into separate
  sub-component files would be premature abstraction. Sections are delimited by the existing
  Separator component.

  ### 6. Styling reuse from featureNodeStateConfig
  The drawer imports `featureNodeStateConfig` and `lifecycleDisplayLabels` directly from
  `components/common/feature-node/feature-node-state-config.ts` (already re-exported via
  `components/common/index.ts`). This ensures visual consistency between the canvas node
  and the drawer content — same icons, colors, and labels.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Phase 1 comes first because the Tier 0 Drawer primitive is a dependency of the Tier 1
  FeatureDrawer. Phase 2 builds the feature-specific component with full test coverage using
  the Drawer from Phase 1. Phase 3 wires everything together in the actual page component.

  This ordering means each phase can be independently verified:
  - **Phase 1**: Storybook stories confirm Drawer opens/closes/animates in all four directions
  - **Phase 2**: Vitest unit tests confirm all 5 states × 6 lifecycle phases render correctly;
    Storybook stories provide visual coverage of every state combination
  - **Phase 3**: Manual verification of the full integration — open/close/switch/Escape/pane-click

  ### Vaul Configuration for Right-Side Non-Modal Drawer

  ```tsx
  <Drawer.Root direction="right" modal={false} open={open} onOpenChange={onOpenChange}>
    <Drawer.Portal>
      <Drawer.Content
        className="fixed inset-y-0 right-0 z-50 flex h-full w-96 flex-col bg-background"
        style={{ '--initial-transform': 'calc(100% + 8px)' }}
      >
        {/* content */}
      </Drawer.Content>
    </Drawer.Portal>
  </Drawer.Root>
  ```

  ### Composed Existing Primitives

  The FeatureDrawer composes these existing UI components:
  - **Badge** (`components/ui/badge.tsx`) — State badge with icon and styled background
  - **Separator** (`components/ui/separator.tsx`) — Between Header, Status, and Details sections
  - **CometSpinner** (`components/ui/comet-spinner.tsx`) — Animated spinner for running state
  - **Lucide icons** — State icons from `featureNodeStateConfig`, XIcon for close button

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | Vaul non-modal + right-direction edge cases | Research confirmed this combination works. Use `--initial-transform: calc(100% + 8px)` CSS variable on DrawerContent. Verify in Storybook before integration. |
  | Escape key conflict between Vaul and useControlCenterState | Both fire clearSelection — selectedNode is set to null either way. No conflict. Verified by reading both implementations. |
  | Drawer portal outside React context providers | Vaul uses React portal which preserves React context (theme, providers). Standard React behavior. |
  | Canvas re-renders when drawer content changes | Drawer is portal-based, outside ReactFlow DOM. FeaturesCanvas does not consume selectedNode. Only ControlCenterInner re-renders, passing new props to FeatureDrawer. |
  | No existing Progress UI component | Use inline div-based progress bar matching feature-node.tsx pattern. Keep it consistent, extract later if needed. |
  | vaul peer dependency compatibility with React 19 | Check vaul's peerDependencies during install. Vaul v1+ supports React 18/19. Fall back to pinning a compatible version if needed. |
  | `selectedNode` carries callback props (onAction, onSettings) | FeatureDrawer should only read data display fields from FeatureNodeData, ignoring callback props. These callbacks are for node interactions, not drawer actions. |
  | Native OS dialog blocks E2E tests | Use Playwright route interception to mock `/api/dialog/pick-files`. Return controlled file paths without spawning actual OS dialogs. |
  | `CreateFeatureFormData` interface change breaks consumers | Only `handleCreateFeatureSubmit` in `useControlCenterState` consumes this type, and it doesn't use `attachments` at all — safe to change from `File[]` to `FileAttachment[]`. |
  | File picker returns paths but no metadata | The API route calls `fs.statSync()` on each returned path to get file size. File name is derived from `path.basename()`. |
  | MIME type unavailable from native picker | Switch icon mapping from MIME-based to extension-based. Use a simple extension lookup (`.png`→image, `.pdf`→pdf, `.ts`→code, etc.). |

  ## Phase 4-5: Native File Picker Integration

  ### Architecture

  Extends the existing native dialog bridge pattern (FolderDialogService → API route → client helper):

  ```
  FeatureCreateDrawer (client)
    → pickFiles() (client helper)
    → POST /api/dialog/pick-files (Next.js API route)
    → FileDialogService.pickFiles() (infrastructure service)
    → OS-native file dialog (osascript / zenity / PowerShell)
    → Returns: FileAttachment[] { path, name, size }
  ```

  ### FileDialogService Design

  New sibling to `FolderDialogService`, same architecture pattern:

  ```typescript
  // Platform-specific commands
  darwin: osascript -e 'set f to (choose file with prompt "Select files" with multiple selections allowed)
          set paths to {} / repeat with i in f / copy POSIX path of i to end of paths / end repeat
          set text item delimiters to "\n" / paths as text'
  linux:  zenity --file-selection --multiple --separator="\n" --title="Select files" 2>/dev/null
  win32:  powershell OpenFileDialog with Multiselect, FileNames joined by newline
  ```

  Returns `string[]` (array of absolute paths) or `null` on cancel.

  ### FileAttachment Interface

  Replaces `File[]` in `CreateFeatureFormData`:

  ```typescript
  interface FileAttachment {
    path: string;   // Full absolute path (e.g., /Users/dev/docs/spec.pdf)
    name: string;   // Filename only (e.g., spec.pdf)
    size: number;   // Size in bytes from fs.statSync()
  }

  interface CreateFeatureFormData {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    attachments: FileAttachment[];  // Changed from File[]
  }
  ```

  ### AttachmentCard Changes

  - Shows full file path as subtitle below the filename
  - Icon mapping uses file extension instead of MIME type
  - File size display unchanged (same formatFileSize utility)

  ### E2E Test Strategy

  The Playwright E2E test uses route interception to avoid spawning actual OS dialogs:

  ```typescript
  await page.route('**/api/dialog/pick-files', (route) =>
    route.fulfill({
      json: {
        files: [{ path: '/Users/test/docs/requirements.pdf', name: 'requirements.pdf', size: 42000 }],
        cancelled: false,
      },
    })
  );
  ```

  Test scenario:
  1. Navigate to control center (/)
  2. Click "+ Add Feature" to open create drawer
  3. Type feature name
  4. Click "Add Files" (triggers mocked native picker)
  5. Verify attachment card shows full path (/Users/test/docs/requirements.pdf)
  6. Submit and verify
