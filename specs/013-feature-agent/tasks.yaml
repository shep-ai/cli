  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Implementation
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-11

  ## Task List

  ### Phase 1: Foundation

  - [ ] {{TASK_1_DESCRIPTION}}
  - [ ] {{TASK_2_DESCRIPTION}}

  ### Phase 2: Core Implementation (TDD Cycle)

  **RED (Write Failing Tests First):**

  - [ ] Write unit tests for {{FEATURE}}

  **GREEN (Implement to Pass Tests):**

  - [ ] Implement {{FEATURE}}

  **REFACTOR (Clean Up):**

  - [ ] Extract helpers and improve code quality

  ## TDD Notes

  - **MANDATORY**: All phases with code follow RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR
  - **RED**: Write failing tests FIRST (never skip this!)
  - **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass tests
  - **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green

  ## Progress Tracking (CRITICAL)

  - **Update checkboxes FREQUENTLY** - as soon as each item is complete!
  - **Don't batch updates** - check off items immediately, not at the end
  - **Commit task.md updates** along with code changes to show progress

  ## Acceptance Checklist

  Before marking feature complete:

  - [ ] All tasks completed
  - [ ] Tests passing (`pnpm test`)
  - [ ] Linting clean (`pnpm lint`)
  - [ ] Types valid (`pnpm typecheck`)
  - [ ] TypeSpec compiles (`pnpm tsp:compile`)
  - [ ] Documentation updated
  - [ ] PR created and reviewed
